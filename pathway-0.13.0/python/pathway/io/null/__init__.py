def write(table: Table) -> None:
    """Writes ``table``'s stream of updates to the empty sink.

    Inside this routine, the data is formatted into the empty object, and then doesn't
    get written anywhere.

    Args:
        table: Table to be written.

    Returns:
        None

    Example:

    One (of a very few) examples, where you can probably need this kind of functionality
    if the case when a Pathway program is benchmarked and the IO part needs to be
    simplified as much as possible.

    If the table is ``table``, the null output can be configured in the following way:

    >>> pw.io.null.write(table)  # doctest: +SKIP
