    """Reads a table from one or several objects from S3 bucket in MinIO.

    In case the prefix is specified, and there are several objects lying under this
    prefix, their order is determined according to their modification times: the smaller
    the modification time is, the earlier the file will be passed to the engine.

    Args:
        path: Path to an object or to a folder of objects in MinIO S3 bucket.
        minio_settings: Connection parameters for the MinIO account and the bucket.
        format: Format of data to be read. Currently ``csv``, ``json``, ``plaintext``,
            ``plaintext_by_object`` and ``binary`` formats are supported. The difference
            between ``plaintext`` and ``plaintext_by_object`` is how the input is
            tokenized: if the ``plaintext`` option is chosen, it's split by the newlines.
            Otherwise, the files are split in full and one row will correspond to one
            file. In case the ``binary`` format is specified, the data is read as raw
            bytes without UTF-8 parsing.
        schema: Schema of the resulting table. Not required for ``plaintext_by_object``
            and ``binary`` formats: if they are chosen, the contents of the read objects
            are stored in the column ``data``.
        mode: If set to ``streaming``, the engine waits for the new objects under the
            given path prefix. Set it to ``static``, it only considers the available
            data and ingest all of it. Default value is ``streaming``.
        csv_settings: Settings for the CSV parser. This parameter is used only in case
            the specified format is "csv".
        json_field_paths: If the format is "json", this field allows to map field names
            into path in the read json object. For the field which require such mapping,
            it should be given in the format ``<field_name>: <path to be mapped>``,
            where the path to be mapped needs to be a
            `JSON Pointer (RFC 6901) <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6901>`_.
        persistent_id: (unstable) An identifier, under which the state of the table
            will be persisted or ``None``, if there is no need to persist the state of this table.
            When a program restarts, it restores the state for all input tables according to what
            was saved for their ``persistent_id``. This way it's possible to configure the start of
            computations from the moment they were terminated last time.
        debug_data: Static data replacing original one when debug mode is active.

    Returns:
        Table: The table read.

    Example:

    Consider that there is a table, which is stored in CSV format in the min.io S3
    bucket. Then, you can use this method in order to connect and acquire its contents.

    It may look as follows:

    >>> import os
    >>> import pathway as pw
    >>> class InputSchema(pw.Schema):
    ...     owner: str
    ...     pet: str
    >>> t = pw.io.minio.read(
    ...     "animals/",
    ...     minio_settings=pw.io.minio.MinIOSettings(
    ...         bucket_name="datasets",
    ...         endpoint="avv749.stackhero-network.com",
    ...         access_key=os.environ["MINIO_S3_ACCESS_KEY"],
    ...         secret_access_key=os.environ["MINIO_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"],
    ...     ),
    ...     format="csv",
    ...     schema=InputSchema,
    ... )

    Please note that this connector is **interoperable** with the **AWS S3** connector,
    therefore all examples concerning different data formats in ``pw.io.s3.read`` also
    work with min.io input.
