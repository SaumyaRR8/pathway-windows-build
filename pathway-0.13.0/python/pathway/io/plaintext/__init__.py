    """Reads a table from a text file or a directory of text files. The resulting table
    will consist of a single column ``data``, and have the number of rows equal to the number
    of lines in the file. Each cell will contain a single line from the file.

    In case the folder is specified, and there are several files placed in the folder,
    their order is determined according to their modification times: the smaller the
    modification time is, the earlier the file will be passed to the engine.

    Args:
        path: Path to the file or to the folder with files or \
`glob <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>`_ pattern for the \
objects to be read. The connector will read the contents of all matching files as well \
as recursively read the contents of all matching folders.
        mode: Denotes how the engine polls the new data from the source. Currently \
"streaming" and "static" are supported. If set to "streaming" the engine will wait for \
the updates in the specified directory. It will track file additions, deletions, and \
modifications and reflect these events in the state. For example, if a file was deleted,\
"streaming" mode will also remove rows obtained by reading this file from the table. On \
the other hand, the "static" mode will only consider the available data and ingest all \
of it in one commit. The default value is "streaming".
        object_pattern: Unix shell style pattern for filtering only certain files in the \
directory. Ignored in case a path to a single file is specified. This value will be \
deprecated soon, please use glob pattern in ``path`` instead.
        with_metadata: When set to true, the connector will add an additional column \
named ``_metadata`` to the table. This column will be a JSON field that will contain two \
optional fields - ``created_at`` and ``modified_at``. These fields will have integral \
UNIX timestamps for the creation and modification time respectively. Additionally, the \
column will also have an optional field named ``owner`` that will contain the name of \
the file owner (applicable only for Un). Finally, the column will also contain a field \
named ``path`` that will show the full path to the file from where a row was filled.
        persistent_id: (unstable) An identifier, under which the state of the table \
will be persisted or ``None``, if there is no need to persist the state of this table. \
When a program restarts, it restores the state for all input tables according to what \
was saved for their ``persistent_id``. This way it's possible to configure the start of \
computations from the moment they were terminated last time.
        autocommit_duration_ms: the maximum time between two commits. Every
          autocommit_duration_ms milliseconds, the updates received by the connector are
          committed and pushed into Pathway's computation graph.
        debug_data: Static data replacing original one when debug mode is active.

    Returns:
        Table: The table read.

    Example:

    >>> import pathway as pw
    >>> t = pw.io.plaintext.read("raw_dataset/lines.txt")
    """

    return pw.io.fs.read(
        path,

        object_pattern=object_pattern,
