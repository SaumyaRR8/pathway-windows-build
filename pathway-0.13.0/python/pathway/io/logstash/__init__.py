    of Logstash. The data is sent in the format of flat JSON objects, with two extra
    fields for time and diff.

    Args:
        table: table to be tracked;
        endpoint: Logstash endpoint, accepting entries;
        n_retries: number of retries in case of failure;
        retry_policy: policy of delays or backoffs for the retries;
        connect_timeout_ms: connection timeout, specified in milliseconds. In case \
it's None, no restrictions on connection duration will be applied;
        request_timeout_ms: request timeout, specified in milliseconds. In case it's \
None, no restrictions on request duration will be applied.

    Example:

    Suppose that we need to send the stream of updates to locally installed Logstash.
    For example, you can use `docker-elk <https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk>`
    repository in order to get the ELK stack up and running at your local machine in a
    few minutes.

    If Logstash stack is installed, you need to configure the input pipeline. The
    simplest possible way to do this, is to add the following lines in the input plugins
    list:

    .. code-block:: text

        http {
            port => 8012
        }

    The port is specified for the sake of example and can be changed. Further, we will
    use 8012 for clarity.

    Now, with the pipeline configured, you can stream the changed into Logstash as
    simple as:

        >>> pw.io.logstash.write(table, "http://localhost:8012")  # doctest: +SKIP
    """

    http_write(
        table,
        url=endpoint,
        n_retries=n_retries,
        retry_policy=retry_policy,
        connect_timeout_ms=connect_timeout_ms,
        request_timeout_ms=request_timeout_ms,
    )
