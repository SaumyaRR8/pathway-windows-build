# Ingesting Unstructured Data

Unstructured data poses a challenge for traditional data processing techniques.
Using Pathway LLM tooling, you can efficiently handle this type of data.

There are two main approaches for ingesting unstructured data:
1. Using a dedicated library: you can use libraries such as [Unstructured](https://unstructured.io/) to parse the unstructured data (PDFs, PPTX, etc.) ingested by Pathway. You can learn more about how to do this in our [Contextful Parsing RAG pipeline example](https://github.com/pathwaycom/llm-app/tree/main/examples/pipelines/contextful_parsing).
2. Using LLM directly: using LLMs, you can directly query unstructured data such as PDFs. For example, you can structure data on the fly and insert them into PostgreSQL: read our [dedicated article](/developers/showcases/unstructured-to-structured) to learn how to do it.
