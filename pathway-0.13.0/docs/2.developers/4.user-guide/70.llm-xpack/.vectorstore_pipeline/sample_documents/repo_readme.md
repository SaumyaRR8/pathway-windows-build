Pathway is an open framework for high-throughput and low-latency real-time data processing. It is used to create Python code which seamlessly combines batch processing, streaming, and real-time API's for LLM apps. Pathway's distributed runtime (ü¶Ä-üêç) provides fresh results of your data pipelines whenever new inputs and requests are received.


In the first place, Pathway was designed to be a life-saver (or at least a time-saver) for Python developers and ML/AI engineers faced with live data sources, where you need to react quickly to fresh data. Still, Pathway is a powerful tool that can be used for a lot of things. If you want to do streaming in Python, build an AI data pipeline, or if you are looking for your next Python data processing framework, keep reading.
