# Easy Testing and CI/CD

Pathway is fully Python-compatible: you can use any of your favorite Python integration tools.

Whether starting a new project or adding Pathway to an existing one, it allows you to choose the best approach that suits your needs.

Pathway can seamlessly be integrated into your CI/CD chain as it is inherently compatible with popular tools such as [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) or [pytest](https://pytest.org/).
Your Pathway pipelines can be automatically tested, built, and deployed, like any other Python workflow.

You can run Pathway tests on offline data snippets locally in any CI/CD pipeline with Python. 
Tests can cover the handling of temporal (late, out of order) aspects of data by comparing results on multiple revisions.
Pathway supports several session-replay mechanisms, such as the demo API.
These allow predictably recreating streaming scenarios within standard CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.)
