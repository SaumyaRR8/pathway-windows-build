# Docker Deployment of Pathway

## Introduction

Deployment is a critical step that should never be overlooked. 
<!-- Pathway can be easily integrated into your existing development pipeline. -->
Pathway is fully compatible with Python and leverages its flexibility to provide various deployment options.

> Pathway is fully Python-compatible: you can use any existing Python deployment method.


Whether starting a new project or adding Pathway to an existing one, it allows you to choose the best approach that suits your needs.

In this article, we will explore how to deploy a Pathway project using Docker.

## Why Docker?


Pathway is meant to be deployed in a containerized manner.
Single-machine deployments can easily be achieved using Docker.
The deployment can run concurrently on multiple cores using multiple processes or threads.
We provide a pathway spawn command to launch multi-process and multi-threaded jobs.
The choice between threads and multiple processes depends on the nature of the computation.
While communication between threads is faster, Python-heavy workloads may require multi-process parallelism to bypass the GIL.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the deployment process, ensure that you have Docker installed on your system.
You can download and install Docker from the official website [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Using the Pathway image

To deploy your Pathway application, you can use the [Pathway Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/pathwaycom/pathway).
It includes all the dependencies required to run Pathway.

### Using a Dockerfile

Using a Dockerfile is an easy way to configure your project using Docker.
To use Pathway, you can set the image to use the Pathway Docker image using the `FROM` command:

```dockerfile
FROM pathwaycom/pathway:latest

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements file and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Command to run the Pathway script
CMD [ "python", "./your-script.py" ]
```

Note that the Pathway Docker image contains everything it needs to run a Pathway application.
If you don't use any other library than Pathway, then there is no need for a `requirements.txt` file.

You can then build and run the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t my-pathway-app .
docker run -it --rm --name my-pathway-app my-pathway-app
```

### Using multi-threading and multi-processing

Pathway allows you to use multi-threading and multi-processing using Pathway CLI.
To run a Pathway application using 2 processes and 3 threads, replace this command:

```dockerfile
CMD [ "python", "./your-script.py" ]
```

by this one:

```dockerfile
CMD ["pathway", "spawn", "--processes", "2", "--threads", "3", "python", "./your-script.py"]
```

### Running a single Python script

When dealing with single-file projects, creating a full-fledged `Dockerfile` might seem unnecessary.
In such scenarios, you can execute a Python script directly using the Python Docker image.
For example:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name my-pathway-app -v "$PWD":/app pathwaycom/pathway:latest python my-pathway-app.py
```

## Using a Python image

Alternatively, Pathway is fully Python-compatible: you can use any existing Python deployment method.
If you prefer using a standard Python image and installing Pathway via pip, you can use such a Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM --platform=linux/x86_64 python:3.10

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements file and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Command to run the Pathway script
CMD [ "python", "./your-script.py" ]
```

⚠️ Pathway is not available on Windows and requires a Python 3.10+ installation.
For compatibility reasons, you should use x86_64 Linux container and a Python 3.10+ image.

Otherwise, it's the same as with the Pathway image, except that you don't need to install Pathway.
You can build and run your image with the same commands as before:

```bash
docker build -t my-pathway-app .
docker run -it --rm --name my-pathway-app my-pathway-app
```

## Example: Log Monitoring with Docker

You can see how to deploy a Pathway project with Docker by looking at our [Realtime Server Log Monitoring](/developers/showcases/realtime-log-monitoring).

## Deploying on the cloud
If you want to scale your Pathway application, you may be interested in deploying Pathway in the cloud.
