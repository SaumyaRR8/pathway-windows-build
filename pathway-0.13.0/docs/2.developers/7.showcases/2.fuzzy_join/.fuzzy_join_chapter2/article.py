# # Interaction with a Feedback Loop.
#
# ## Fuzzy Join - reconciliation with audit: when the computer is not enough
#
# In this article, we are going to show you how Pathway interacts with incremental data flows with a **feedback loop**.
#
# In the [another showcase](/developers/showcases/fuzzy_join/fuzzy_join_chapter1) we explained how `smart_fuzzy_join` may be helpful in bookkeeping.
# Previously, we had a simple pipeline that matched entries of two different tables, such as two logs of bank transfers, in two different formats.
# Many matchings can be inferred automatically, but some can be really tricky without help: while the fans of Harry Potter can instantaneously make the connection between 'You-Know-Who' and 'Voldemort', it is impossible for a computer to do so, at least without help.
#
# Human audit is unavoidable in many areas such as accounting or banking.
# As such, we extend our pipeline with an auditor that supervises the process of reconciliation.
# The auditor may help the system by providing some hints, i.e. suggesting difficult matchings by hand.
#
# ## Feedback loop in Pathway
# ![Graph image](/assets/content/showcases/fuzzy_join/reconciliation_chapter3_trim.png)
#
# This figure represents an architecture with a feedback loop to understand how the pieces work together.
#
# Reconciliation by SmartFuzzyJoin lies at the heart of the architecture:
# - it consumes inputs from 3 sources:
#   - two tables with transactions in different formats;
#   - a table with manual corrections provided by the auditor;
# - it outputs one table with matched records.
#
# You might think of the auditor as a simple automaton.
# Either they are satisfied with presented results and simply save them in some storage, or they provide some hints for the algorithm to find a better matching.
#
# **Note:** Although the architecture contains a feedback loop, all tables here are either inputs or outputs of the system.
#
#
# ## The data
#
# Human audit is certainly needed to handle the sample dataset below.
#
#  **Recipient and sender in a 'standard' CSV format**
#
# |id    |recipient|sender       |
# |------|---------|-------------|
# |1     |Bill H.  |Nancy R.     |
# |2     |Harry P. |Hermione  G. |
# |3     |Julian S.|Dick F.      |
#
#
#  **Messages describing the transactions**
#
# |id    |message  |
# |------|---------|
# |A     |Dear William, thank you for your patience. Regards, Ann|
# |B     |Dear Colleague! I think they might have sent me your particle! Yours, Richard|
# |C     |Paying back for two Chocolate Frogs, cheers Hermione!|

# ## Automatic reconciliation
# Let's see how many records we can match without any human help.
# We reuse code from [Part 1 of this showcase](/developers/showcases/fuzzy_join/fuzzy_join_chapter1).

# Not a perfect matching. It seems that the help of an auditor is needed.
#
#
# ## Incremental reconciliation with an auditor
# The correct matching is 1 - A, 2 - C and 3 - B. Why? [Tip 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%28given_name%29), [Tip 2](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1965/summary/).
#
# Previously, the algorithm identified matching 2 - C correctly but failed to find the connections between the other pairs.
# Now, we run it with a hint - feedback from an auditor.
#
# To include the hint (nothing complicated), we just need to launch our function with the parameter `audit`:

# %%
pw.debug.compute_and_print(suggested_matchings)
# %% [markdown]
# Given this feedback, we check that the new matching took into account this pair:
# %%
pw.debug.compute_and_print(matching)

# %% [markdown]
# Still not perfect but better. It seems that more help from the auditor is needed.
# Now, with one more extra hint the algorithm matches all the records correctly.
# %%

pw.debug.compute_and_print(audit)

# %%
matching, suggested_matchings = reconcile_transactions(

)

# %% [markdown]
# This time we provide the last pair, 3 - B:
# %%
pw.debug.compute_and_print(suggested_matchings)
# %% [markdown]
# Given those, we should obtain a full --and hopefully correct -- matching.
# %%
pw.debug.compute_and_print(matching)

# %% [markdown]
# Bingo!
#
# It may sound long and tedious but in practice most of the matchings should have been done automatically.
# This process is only performed for the few remaining cases, where the linkages are hard to make.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Conclusion
# In conclusion, writing pipelines with a feedback loop is as easy as can be.
# When writing such a data processing algorithm, a tip is to always clearly separate inputs from outputs.
# It is important because the Pathway engine observes inputs for any changes and recalculates parts of the computation when needed.
#
#
# In the next chapter, we will show you how to make a Pathway installation which provides a full Fuzzy-Matching application, complete with frontend. (Coming soon!)
