# # Real-Time Shortest Paths on Dynamic Networks with Bellman-Ford in Pathway
# This article explains step-by-step how the Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm may be implemented in Pathway.
#
# ## Introduction
#
# The [Bellman-Ford algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm&oldid=1088801570) computes the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all the other
# vertices in a weighted graph.
# A weighted graph is composed of a set of points, called *vertices*, which are connected via *edges*. Each edge is associated to a value, called either *weight* or *distance*.
# For instance, the set of all the cities and the roads which connect them form such a graph. In that example, the Bellman-Ford algorithm would help to find the fastest way, in terms of distance, to go from a given city to another.
#
# This article is also a perfect place to familiarize yourself with several constructs used in Pathway.
#
# ## Code
# First things first - imports ðŸ™‚
# %%
import math

import pathway as pw


# %% [markdown]
# ### I/O Data
# The input is a weighted graph so it is natural to split representation of the data
# into two parts: Vertices and Edges. Their schemas:
# %%
class Vertex(pw.Schema):
    is_source: bool


class Edge(pw.Schema):
    u: pw.Pointer[Vertex]
    v: pw.Pointer[Vertex]
    dist: int


# %% [markdown]
# These schemas have a natural interpretation. You can think of the `Edge` schema as of
# a blueprint of a table that has 3 columns: `u`, `v` (foreign keys) and `dist`.
# The output schema:


# %%
class DistFromSource(pw.Schema):
    dist_from_source: int


# %% [markdown]
# *Note:* The schemas inherit from `pw.Schema` special class.
#
# *Note:* You might wonder why output schema has only one column `dist_from_source`.
# Actually, you can join schemas together to create a new one. And so, the output schema
#  is `Vertex + DistFromSource`. (Look for that type annotation later in the code.)
#
# ### The algorithm
# The Bellman-Ford algorithm performs some number of relaxations until it reaches a [fixed point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_(mathematics) "Wipedia article of 'fixed point'").
#
# #### Relaxations
# Each node checks if a path via it would make any so-far-optimal path to some other
# node shorter.


# %%
def bellman_ford_step(
    vertices_dist: pw.Table[DistFromSource], edges: pw.Table[Edge]
) -> pw.Table[DistFromSource]:
    relaxed_edges = edges + edges.select(
        dist_from_source=vertices_dist.ix(edges.u).dist_from_source + edges.dist
    )
    vertices_dist = vertices_dist.update_rows(
        relaxed_edges.groupby(id=relaxed_edges.v).reduce(
            dist_from_source=pw.reducers.min(relaxed_edges.dist_from_source),
        )
    )

    return vertices_dist


# %% [markdown]
# #### Fixed point
# The relaxations are iterated until a fixed point is reached. In this case, reaching a
# fixed point means that no new (shorter) path was found in the last iteration.
# %%
def bellman_ford(vertices: pw.Table[Vertex], edges: pw.Table[Edge]):
    vertices_dist: pw.Table[DistFromSource] = vertices.select(
        dist_from_source=pw.if_else(vertices.is_source, 0.0, math.inf)
    )

    fixed_point = pw.iterate(
        lambda iterated, edges: dict(
            iterated=bellman_ford_step(vertices_dist=iterated, edges=edges)
        ),
        # The `pw.iterate_universe` stanza informs iterate that `vertices_dist` grows with each loop iteration. Without it, the system assumes that iterations don't change the set of indices of a table.
        iterated=pw.iterate_universe(vertices_dist),
        edges=edges,
    ).iterated

    return fixed_point.join(vertices, fixed_point.id == vertices.id).select(
        vertices.key, fixed_point.dist_from_source
    )

#  ## Tests
#
#  Now, let's see the code in action. The following test case runs Bellman-Ford
# algorithm on a graph depicted below.

# a directed graph
vertices = pw.debug.table_from_markdown(
    """
  | key | is_source
1 | 1   | True
2 | 2   | False
3 | 3   | False
4 | 4   | False
5 | 5   | False
6 | 6   | False
7 | 7   | False
"""
).with_id_from(pw.this.key)

edges = pw.debug.table_from_markdown(
    """
    | u  | v | dist
11 | 1  | 2 | 100
12 | 1  | 3 | 200
13 | 1  | 4 | 300
14 | 3  | 5 | 100
15 | 3  | 6 | 500

"""
).with_columns(
    u=vertices.pointer_from(pw.this.u),
    v=vertices.pointer_from(pw.this.v),
)

# %% [markdown]
# Pathway automatically reindexes the tables, so we need a key column of the `vertices` table and we need ask Pathway to reindex the table using those.
# In practice, Pathway uses pointers so the keys are automatically converted into pointers.
#
# For the edges, we have to convert the keys into their references in order to be able to use `vertices_dist.ix(edges.u)` as `ix` only works with pointers.

# %%
pw.debug.compute_and_print(bellman_ford(vertices, edges))

# %% [markdown]
# That was a simple introduction to writing code and tests in Pathway.
#
# Feel free to take this code and experiment with it ðŸ™‚  Do you see any possibility to
# improve the code? (What happens when there is a negative cycle in the graph?)
#

# %% [markdown]
# ## Summary
# The code above follows a pattern that is quite frequent when working with Pathway:
# - Define I/O data types
# - Define transformations on tables
# - Iterate the transformation until a fixed point is reached
#   - usually transforms the data by a simple one-liner.
#   - for example ```iterate(lambda foo, bar: {foo=fn(foo, bar), bar=bar}, foo=input_table_1, bar=input_table2).foo```
