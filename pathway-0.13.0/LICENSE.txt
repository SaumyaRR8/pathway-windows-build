    Releases of Pathway covered by this License contain a copy of this License

Additional Use Grant:
    The Licensor grants you (the licensee) additional rights to the Licensed
    Work, whereby you are entitled to run the Licensed Work in production
    use, at no cost, subject to all of the following conditions: 
    (a) in a single installation of the Licensed Work you may run the Licensed
    Work on only one machine, physical or virtual, and without exceeding the
    number of worker threads and processes allowed by the configuration of the
    software runner of the distribution; and 
    (b) the additional right to use granted herein applies to the exclusion
    of use of the Licensed Work for a Stream Data Processing Service, as well
    as to the exclusion of use of any modified or derivative Licensed Work,
    in particular:
    - you may not move, change, disable, or circumvent any license key
    or resource limiting functionality that may be present in the software,
    and you may not remove or obscure any functionality in the software that
    is protected by the license key or circumvent resource limits,
    - you may not alter, remove, or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other
    notices of the licensor in the software; 
    (c) the production use of modified Licensed Work is permitted only where
    the modifications of the Licensed Work are indispensable to fix bugs or
    vulnerabilities which might otherwise alter the scope of functionalities
    of the Licensed Work, as described in API documentation available at
    https://pathway.com/developers/documentation/api-docs/pathway; and
    (d) this entire License including its Additional Use Grant shall remain
    in full force and effect for any use under this Additional Use Grant,
    thus covering the Licensed Work and also binding any and all users of
    the Licensed Work. 
    A “Stream Data Processing Service” is defined as any offering that allows
    third parties (other than your employees or individual contractors) to
    access the functionality of the Licensed Work by performing an action
    directly or indirectly that causes the deployment, creation, or change to
    the structure of a running computation graph of Pathway on any machine.
    For the sake of clarity, a Stream Data Processing Service would include
    providers of infrastructure services, such as cloud services, hosting
    services, data center services and similarly situated third parties
    (including affiliates of such entities) that would offer the Licensed
    Work, possibly in connection with a broader service offering, to their
    customers or subscribers.
 
Change Date:
    Change date is four years from the date of code merge into the main
    release branch of Pathway in the GitHub repo (and in no case earlier
    than July 20, 2027). Please see GitHub commit history for exact
    dates.
