## Differential Dataflow operators

Differential dataflow programs are fundamentally build out of operators applied to collections. These operators result in collections, to which we apply more and more operators. Ideally, the operators we assemble compute something exciting and meaningful.

This chapter surveys the most common differential dataflow operators, and shows how to use each of them.
