## The Arrange Operator

The `arrange` operator is a massively important operator that we will discuss in more detail in the chapter on Arrangements. Arrange controls and coordinates how data are stored, indexed, and maintained, and forms the basis of efficient data sharing.

Operators like `consolidate`, `join`, and `reduce` all use `arrange` internally, and there can be substantial benefit to exposing this use. We will discuss this further.
